My Tableau story:

NYC CitiBike has an extensive data, so I picked up middle of the pandemics, April 2020

Question 1: Which parts of the city are considered to be safe eniugh to pick up a bike late at night? 
D1: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.kirillova.smirny/viz/D1NightTimevsEarlyMorningCitiBikeStartStations/Dashboard1
My criteria: 10 or more bike rentals at that hour. 
The time up to 30 min before the hour and 30 mon after the hour.
Late night time range I picked is from 11 pm (22:30) to 1 am (1:29). 
There were not enough trips registered after 1 am to warrant their inclusion in the data set. 
I did not include 10 pm (22:00) trips becuase it enlarged my dataset enourmously, making it impossible to draw any conclusions.

Answer 1: The area from 4st up to 111 st in Manhattan looks crowded enough at light night to warrant a bike rental. 

Question 2: Is there a difference in the peak hours of CitiBike rentals at weekdays vs weekends?
D2: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.kirillova.smirny/viz/D2CitiBikePeakRentalHoursWeekdaysvsWeekends/Dashboard2

Answer 2: Yes, the peak hour during working week is around 17:00 (5pm) and around 14:00 (2pm) at the weekend.

Question 3: Are there days of the week when the most and the lest bikes are rented?
D2: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.kirillova.smirny/viz/D2CitiBikePeakRentalHoursWeekdaysvsWeekends/Dashboard2

Answer 3: Friday seems to be less popular day to rent CitiBikes. There are also more bikes rented monthly (3x) during weekdays than on Saturdays (2X).

Question 4: At what time CitiBikes are most likely to be picked up by hourly riders? 
D5: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.kirillova.smirny/viz/D5SubscribervsCustomerPeakHours/Dashboard5

Answer 4: Hourly customers prefer to rent their bikes either in the middle of the day both at weekends and during the week. During working week there are many riders who pick up the bikes from 17:00 to 19:00 (after work).

Disclaimer: Public tableau provides only limited data, so in my analysis weekday means Wed, Thu or Fri, while weekend includes only Sat.

Interesting that there are significantly less bike rentals on Fridays. 
The peak hour remains the same, 6pm (17:30-18:29).

Curious fact 1: The most bikes in NYC during April of 2020 were rented by the people, born in 1969.
Explanation: People who rent bikes hourly are not required to specify their age, so they are assigned a default birth year of 1969.

D3: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.kirillova.smirny/viz/D3_NumberofCitiBikeTripsperBirthYear/Dashboard3
D4: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julia.kirillova.smirny/viz/D4NumberofCitiBikeTripsperBirthYear/Dashboard4

Riders picking up CitiBike for few hours do not have to specify either their birth year or their gender. By default they assigned 1969 as the birth year and neutral (0) as the gender. You can see this bias clearly if you filter out neutral gender.
