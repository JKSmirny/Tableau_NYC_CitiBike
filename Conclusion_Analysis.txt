# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics
My Tableau story:

NYC CitiBike has an extensive data, so I picked up middle of the pandemics, April 2020

Question 1: Which parts of the city are considered to be safe eniugh to pick up a bike late at night? 
Dashboard 1, Dashboard 2
My criteria: 25 or more bike rentals at that hour. 
The time up to 30 min before the hour and 30 mon after the hour.
Late night time range I picked is from 11 pm (22:30) to 1 am (1:29). 
There were not enough trips registered after 1 am to warrant their inclusion in the data set. 
I did not include 10 pm (22:00) trips becuase it enlarged my dataset enourmously, making it impossible to draw any conclusions.

Answer 1: The area from 4st up to 96st in Manhattan looks crowded enough at light night to warrant a bike rental. 
There is also a large cluster of bike rentals around 11 pm (23:00) next to The Continental Army Plaza in Brooklyn. 
Looks like people living tin that area pick up bikes when they arrive there via either subway of a bus.

Question 2a: Is there a gender difference in late night bikes' pick up numbers in NYC??
Dashboard 2,  Sheet 4A, Table_1, Sheet 5A
Late night time range I picked here is from 10 pm (22:30) to 1 am (1:29)

Answer 2a: There are 3 times more male bike riders during late night hours as female ones.

Question 2b: What is a gender difference in early morning bikes' pick up numbers in NYC?
Sheet 4B, Table_2, Sheet 5B
The time up to 30 min before the hour and 30 mon after the hour.
Early morning time range I picked is from 4 am (3:30) to 6 am (6:29). 
Note: I have excluded the riders who have not specified their gender (none before 5:30, 5% between 5:30 and 6:30)

Answer 2b: There is a significant difference in number of female and male riders 
in the early morning hours in NYC: on average there are 3 times more male riders than females (75% vs 25%).

Additionally, there is a drastic increase in the riders' numbers after 5:30: 
there are 3 times more bikes pick-up's at 5 am than at 4 am,
there are 4 times as many bike pick-up's at 6 am than at 5 am,
there are 8 times as many bike pick-up's at 6 am than at 4 am. 

Interesting that the most early morning bike riders in the early morning rent their bikes monthly. 
Hourly renters do not appear at all until 5:30 am and even then they only account for 5%.

Question 3: Is there a difference in the peak hours of bike rental during weekday and weekend? 
Sheet 7A, Sheet 7B, Sheet 9A, Sheet 9B

Answer 3: The peak hours of bike rental on the wekends are from 2pm to 5 pm (13:30-17:29), 
while during weekdays the most bikes are picked ap at around 6pm (17:30-18:29).

Interesting that theare significantly more bike rentals from Tue to Thu than on Mon and Fri. 
The peak hour remains the same, 6pm (17:30-18:29).

Curious fact 1: The most bikes in NYC during April of 2020 were rented by the people, born in 1969.
Explanation: People who rent bikes hourly are not required to specify their age, so they are assigned a default birth year of 1969.
If you look at monthly bike renters, there is not such phenomenon. 
Dashboard 2, Sheet 3

Curious fact 2: 
Female riders tend to pick up bikes in the middle of the day, so do the hourly renters.
